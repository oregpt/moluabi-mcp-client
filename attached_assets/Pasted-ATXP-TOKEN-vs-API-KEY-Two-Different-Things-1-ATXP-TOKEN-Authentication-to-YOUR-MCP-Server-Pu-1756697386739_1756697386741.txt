ATXP TOKEN vs API KEY - Two Different Things!
1. ATXP TOKEN = Authentication to YOUR MCP Server
Purpose: Proves the client is authorized to call your MCP server
Where: Goes in the Authorization header
What it does: Allows access to your server + handles USDC payment
Generated by: ATXP OAuth flow
2. API KEY = Authentication to MoluAbi Platform
Purpose: Proves the user owns their MoluAbi account
Where: Goes inside the tool arguments as apiKey
What it does: Allows your server to call MoluAbi APIs on behalf of the user
Format: mab_xxxxx (MoluAbi API key)
CREATE_AGENT Example - Both Are Needed!
curl -X POST "https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ATXP_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0", 
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "create_agent",
      "arguments": {
        "name": "My Support Bot",
        "description": "Customer support assistant", 
        "instructions": "Be helpful and polite",
        "type": "support",
        "isPublic": false,
        "apiKey": "mab_cc4d049cbae6dcc3f55cd171fc3e3c29a1601ee132c93b751a26d5105b744ff1"
      }
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
What Happens Step by Step:
ATXP TOKEN authenticates client to your MCP server
ATXP payment processes $0.05 USDC to your wallet (0x7F9D1a87...)
API KEY authenticates your server to MoluAbi platform
Agent created in user's MoluAbi account
Response sent back with success + payment confirmation
The Flow:
Client → [ATXP TOKEN] → Your MCP Server → [API KEY] → MoluAbi Platform
                    ↓
               Payment: $0.05 USDC → Your Wallet
Both are required! Without ATXP token = no access. Without API key = can't create agent in MoluAbi.

PERFECT.... WHAT CALL DO WE MAKE TO GET THE atxpTOKEN THO

Just now
Perfect question! The ATXP TOKEN is obtained through an OAuth flow. Here's exactly how to get it:

Getting the ATXP TOKEN - OAuth Flow
Step 1: Client Registration
Your client needs to register with ATXP and get OAuth credentials:

// This happens once during client setup
const atxpClient = new AtxpClient({
  serverUrl: "https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/",
  // Other ATXP config
});
Step 2: OAuth Authorization Request
// Client initiates OAuth flow
const authUrl = await atxpClient.getAuthorizationUrl();
// User visits this URL in browser to authorize
Step 3: OAuth Token Exchange
// After user authorizes, client gets the token
const tokenResponse = await atxpClient.exchangeCodeForToken(authCode);
const atxpToken = tokenResponse.access_token;
Step 4: Use Token for MCP Calls
curl -X POST "https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer THE_ATXP_TOKEN_FROM_STEP_3" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/call", ...}'
From Your Test Logs - This Already Worked!
Looking at your client test logs, this OAuth flow was successful:

[atxp] Successfully registered client with ID: 8c81f4913ddffeb92978320b917786ca
[atxp] Saving new access token for user: atxp:tRwEwUc5CYhmPPa5NfZgB
Your client already has the ATXP token! The token gets automatically included in the Authorization: Bearer header when your client makes MCP calls.

The OAuth flow happens automatically in the ATXP SDK - your client just needs to call the ATXP methods and it handles getting/refreshing tokens behind the scenes.
