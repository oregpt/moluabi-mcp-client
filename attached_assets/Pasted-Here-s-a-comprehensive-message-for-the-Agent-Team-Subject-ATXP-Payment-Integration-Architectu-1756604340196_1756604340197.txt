Subject: ATXP Payment Integration - Architecture Analysis & Solution Path

Hi Agent Team,

After thoroughly analyzing the MCP server integration, I can provide clarity on the ATXP payment processing issue and the recommended solution path.

Current Situation Analysis
✅ MCP Server Status: 100% Ready for Production

ATXP provider fully configured and operational
Payment destination set correctly
@atxp/server SDK properly integrated and initialized
All tools returning accurate costs and executing successfully
❌ Client-Side Payment Issue: Direct API Approach Not Working

Client is making direct HTTP calls to ATXP REST endpoints
All ATXP payment API endpoints returning 404 errors
This suggests ATXP's direct REST API layer may not be operational yet
Root Cause: Architecture Mismatch
The issue isn't with the MCP server - it's with the payment integration approach:

Current Architecture (Problematic):

Client → MCP Server (for tools) + Direct ATXP APIs (for payments)
         ✅ Working                ❌ 404 errors
Recommended Architecture (Working):

Client → MCP Server → ATXP SDK → Payment Processing
         ✅ Ready    ✅ Works    ✅ Internal Protocol
Technical Details
What's Working:

MCP server's requirePayment() function using ATXP SDK
Cost calculation and usage tracking
Payment validation through SDK (not REST APIs)
What's Failing:

Direct client calls to ATXP REST endpoints
Account balance retrieval via HTTP APIs
Payment processing via external API calls
Solution: SDK-Only Integration
Recommended Changes:

Remove all direct ATXP API calls from client-side code
Rely entirely on MCP server for payment processing
Trust SDK-based payment flow through requirePayment()
Benefits:

Eliminates 404 errors (no direct API calls)
Simpler architecture (single integration point)
Uses ATXP's official SDK approach
MCP server handles all payment complexity
Implementation Path
Client Changes Needed:

Remove direct ATXP API integrations
Call MCP tools normally and handle success/failure responses
Let MCP server manage all payment validation
MCP Server Status:

Already configured for this approach
No changes needed - ready for production
SDK integration fully operational
Next Steps
The MCP server is production-ready for SDK-only ATXP integration. The focus should be on updating the client to remove direct API calls and trust the MCP server's payment handling through the ATXP SDK.

This approach aligns with ATXP's intended server-side integration pattern and eliminates the API availability issues you're experiencing.

This message clarifies that the MCP server is ready and the solution is architectural - moving to SDK-only integration rather than mixed SDK + direct API approach.
