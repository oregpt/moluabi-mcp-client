# MCP Server Initialization Diagnostic

Hi team,

We received a report that our MCP server may be missing the `initialize` method when someone tried to integrate it with ATXP. I need you to check our server implementation and verify several key components are properly implemented.

## Primary Issue: Missing Initialize Method

**Question 1:** Does our MCP server properly handle the `initialize` request/method?
- Check if we have an initialization handler that responds to the MCP client's initial handshake
- This should be automatically handled if we're using the official MCP SDK, but please verify

**If missing:** The initialize method is critical for MCP protocol compliance. It establishes the session and tells the client what capabilities our server supports.

## Session Management Requirements

**Question 2:** Do we properly implement session management?
- Do we generate and return a session ID in the `Mcp-Session-Id` HTTP header during initialization?
- Do we validate this session ID on subsequent requests?
- Do we return a 404 when a session expires to trigger re-initialization?

**If missing:** Implement session tracking using an in-memory store (Map/object) that associates session IDs with client connections.

## Transport Configuration

**Question 3:** What transport method(s) does our server support?
- [ ] STDIO (for local servers)
- [ ] HTTP/Streamable HTTP (for remote servers) 
- [ ] SSE (legacy, being deprecated)

**Verify:** Our server should match the transport method that ATXP expects to use.

## Core MCP Protocol Implementation

**Question 4:** Please verify we properly implement these core MCP methods:
- [ ] `initialize` - Initial handshake and capability exchange
- [ ] `list_tools` - Return available tools
- [ ] `list_resources` - Return available resources (if we have any)
- [ ] `list_prompts` - Return available prompts (if we have any)
- [ ] `call_tool` - Execute tool requests
- [ ] `read_resource` - Serve resource content (if applicable)

## Server Metadata and Capabilities

**Question 5:** Do we properly declare our server metadata during initialization?
```json
{
  "name": "our-server-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "capabilities": {
    "tools": {},
    "resources": {},
    "prompts": {}
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

**Question 6:** Do we implement proper error responses?
- JSON-RPC compliant error format
- Proper error codes for different failure scenarios
- Include the original request ID in error responses

## Additional Verification Steps

**Question 7:** Can you test our server with MCP Inspector?
```bash
# Install MCP CLI tools
uv add "mcp[cli]"

# Test our server
mcp dev path/to/our/server.py
```
This will show if initialization and other protocol methods work correctly.

**Question 8:** Are we using the official MCP SDK?
- Python: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` or `mcp[cli]`
- TypeScript: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- C#: Microsoft's MCP SDK

If yes, these should handle initialization automatically. If no, we may need to implement the protocol manually.

## Expected Server Structure

For reference, a properly initialized MCP server should look something like this:

**Python (FastMCP):**
```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("our-server-name")

@mcp.tool()
def our_tool(param: str) -> str:
    """Tool description"""
    return f"Result: {param}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport='stdio')  # or 'http'
```

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
const server = new McpServer({
  name: "our-server-name",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// Tool registrations...

server.connect(transport);
```

## Action Items

1. **Immediate:** Check if `initialize` method exists and responds correctly
2. **Verify:** All core MCP methods are implemented  
3. **Test:** Run MCP Inspector to validate protocol compliance
4. **Document:** What transport method(s) we support
5. **Confirm:** Session management is working properly

Please let me know your findings for each question, and we can troubleshoot any missing pieces together.

Thanks!
